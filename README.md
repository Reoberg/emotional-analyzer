# Emotion Analyzing in Videos

First of all, downloaded the necessary tools that I am going to use and created a main.py file which I will run and do analyses process. Created different folder for tools I am going to use. 

py -m pip install pytube moviepy speechrecognition spacy nltk NRCLex Path TextBlob googletrans==4.0.0-rc1      
- To download videos on Youtube  pytube
- To arrange the path of files  Path
- To extract video to audio file  moviepy
- To extract audio to text file  speech_recognition
- To translate text files to Spanish  TextBlob and googletrans
Then I created a text file named video_urls.txt to hold the urls of videos on youtube which we are going to download and analyze.
